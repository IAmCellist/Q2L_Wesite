  <h4 class="header_1">Introduction</h4>
  <p>Quest2Learn is an augmented reality (AR) application that enhances both online and on-campus lab sciences education. Our team has created an app in development with exciting technology using augmented reality and game design to teach courses in lab sciences. Currently, we are developing lab units with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) faculty members. Through Quest2Learn, we aim to address the lack of access to hands-on lab learning during the pandemic. Furthermore, our goal is to enhance lab experiences even when in-person learning resumes, and excite students about pursuing careers in biomedical sciences, as well as exposing underprivileged communities to state-of-the-art lab science education.&nbsp;</p>
  <br/>
	  <h4 class="header_1">Why are we developing Quest2Learn?</h4>
  <p>· The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted education for many, highlighting the lack of adequate online lab learning platforms. Unlike lectures that have transitioned online via video conference apps, laboratory subjects that rely on training tactile laboratory skills and specific equipment are not as easily adapted.
	  <br>
· Our goal is that Quest2Learn will provide students with an interactive way to learn laboratory techniques in a virtual setting, through a simulated lab learning experience in AR and a "gamification" approach. With interactive and realistic simulations, students can develop practical hands-on lab skills.
	  <br>
· Our simulations are developed hand in hand with faculty at JHU based on their lab courses to ensure content accuracy and credibility. Quest2Learn will be used in the course setting to enhance the ability of instructors to teach both remotely and in person as part of JHU and beyond.</p>
